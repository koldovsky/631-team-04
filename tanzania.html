                grass, baby elephants are born, lions hunt. This is a world on the other side of the hemisphere, wild
                and beautiful, which will make you feel like a pioneer and see exotic animals in their natural habitat.
                At the end of the program, you can relax on the white beaches of Zanzibar. We travel through the whole
                territory of Tanzania, from Serengeti to Kilimanjaro.</p>

            <h2>Itinerary</h2>
            <p>Day 1: Moshi – Lake Manyara National Park</p>
            <p>We start our safari trip with a drive to the Lake Manyara National Park. Founded in 1960, the small
                Lake
                Manyara National Park is home to tree-climbing lions, elephants and large troops of baboons and
                monkeys.
                The park is dominated by the shallow, alkaline lake and boasts with diverse habitats like grassy
                plains,
                escarpment, and forest. Here hundreds of bird species gather including the legendary pink flamingos.
                In
                addition to the stunning scenery, you have the chance to meet giraffes, buffaloes, hippos,
                wildebeests
                and the comical warthog. The safari jeep has an open roof and is the great viewing platform to
                appreciate the nature and animals of this park. In the late afternoon, you will leave the park and
                drive
                to the selected lodge, where you will spend the night.</p>

                <p>Day 2: Lake Manyara Area – Serengeti National Park</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>After a deep sleep we will go towards the fertile crater highlands where the local people grow
                    wheat,
                    corn and coffee. By midday we will reach the plains of the Serengeti National Park, the most
                    stunning
                    park in Tanzania. The Serengeti has a diversity of landscapes including short grass plains,
                    savannah,
                    thick bush, swamps and lakes and it is famous for the yearly migration when hundred thousands of
                    wildebeest and zebras trek to find fresh grass and water. On our way to the hotel we will show
                    you,
                    where the word Serengeti (plains in the language of the Maasai) comes from. We reach the hotel
                    in
                    the
                    early evening so that you have enough time to have a dinner and rest.</p>

                <p>Day 3: Serengeti National Park</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>This day we spend on a game drive in the Serengeti National Park. During the rainy season in
                    November
                    and
                    December the herds move from the hills in the north to the plains in the south, so we chase them
                    on
                    their route. A visit to the Serengeti Visitor Centre is also possible. Here you can learn more
                    about
                    the
                    history of the park and the research that is being done by the Frankfurter Zoological Society.
                    After
                    a
                    day full of emotions we come back to the hotel near the national park, and have a rest.</p>

                <p>Day 4: Serengeti National Park – Ngorongoro Conservation Area</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>We continue exploring the Serengeti National Park. In the Seronera Valley we might be lucky to
                    see
                    predators hunt as animals gather at the waters. After lunch we rush in the direction of the
                    Ngorongoro
                    Crater. As soon as we have reached the crater you will have a superb view of the caldera. This
                    20 km
                    wide crater is part of an UNESCO World Heritage Site and is hosts over 20,000 animals. This
                    evening,
                    we
                    stay in a local hotel right on the crater from which you'll have the opportunity to witness one
                    of
                    the
                    most incredible sunsets in your life!</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Rise and shine! At the start of our last safari day we drive down the steep path into the crater
                    just.
                    The Ngorongoro Crater is the largest, unbroken and unflooded caldera in the world and it has an
                    incredible diversity of wildlife. In addition to zebras and wildebeests, we might also spot the
                    rare
                    black rhino and other members of the “Big Five” – lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino and leopard.
                    The
                    crater
                    also hosts other animals such as hyenas, waterbucks, bushbucks, eland and more than 500 bird
                    species.
                    After an extensive drive and a picnic lunch we will leave the caldera in and drive back to
                    Arusha.
                    Those
                    who want to continue their journey on the white sands of Zanzibar are transferred there, others
                    spent
                    the night in Arusha.</p>
